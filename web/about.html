      <p id="p">Dear fellow Students,<br><br>My friends and I personally don't want to get into trouble so I'm going to call myself the Secret Server Owner (SSO). This website and server wasn't made by <a href="https://detox.detoxnetwork.repl.co/">Detox Network</a> but by a very talented person (SSO). Me, SSO decided to deliver a better Minecraft Server than the one a few weeks ago. The old one was laggy, slow, and was on a old version. I now bring you the Official Ottoson Middle School Minecraft Server. This new server can theoretically be connected through the 1.8.8 Minecraft Client. This new server upgrades from the very ancient Minecraft version 1.5 to the newer and the most popular version of Minecraft, 1.8. I used the EaglerCraftX Client to play real 1.8 Minecraft on the web and a premium server to create the perfect Survival Minecraft Experiance on the Web. I have also added better plugins and tools to create a more immersive and quality feel.  I hope you enjoy what I have made.<br><br>Enjoy!<br>SSO</p>
